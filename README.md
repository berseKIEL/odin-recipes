The current project is to practice all the knowledge adquired via
representing a basic recipe website starting from Git to HTML.

This page doesn't have to be pretty but to be an excersive to
mentalize how to create a HTML page from where then you'll
have to personalize and in future style it up with CSS and
add basic functionalities with JavaScript
