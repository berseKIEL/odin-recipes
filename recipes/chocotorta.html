    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      The chocotorta Argentina dessert is one of the most popular Argentina desserts that’s eaten at home and not at restaurants. The preparation is somewhat similar to a classic tiramisu or a
      grandmother’s biscuit cake. In Spanish, chocotorta literally translates to “chocolate cake.” It is a traditional Argentina dessert that is typically made for birthdays.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Dulce de Leche</li>
      <li>Cream Cheese</li>
      <li>Creme fraiche or sour cream (optional)</li>
      <li>Chocolinas or any brand of chocolate cookies</li>
      <li>One cup of freshly brewed coffee</li>
      <li>Valrhona dark chocolate (85%) or any quality dark chocolate for garnishing</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Mix the dulce de leche and cream cheese with a mixer set on low speed for two minutes — preferably, leave the cream cheese at room temperature for at least 15 minutes before mixing, so it's
          easier to mix.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Line a deep 20X20cm baking pan (the bottom and the sides) with parchment paper, leaving enough to overhang, for easier unmolding.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Start assembling the cake. Dip each cookie shortly in coffee, then place each on the pan's bottom, creating a cookie layer, and then spread it with a thin layer of dulce de leche and cream
          cheese mixture.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Repeat this step five more times — you should end up with 6 cookie layers and five layers of dulce de leche and cream cheese mixture.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Refrigerate for a minimum of six hours.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Once ready to serve, take out of the refrigerator, place a large tray on the top of the pan, and flip to invert the cake onto the said tray. Remove the parchment paper.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          For decorating the cake, make a 300g mixture of dulce de leche and cream cheese, then spread the top of the cake thinly with the said mixture. Save some of the mixture of decorating later.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Prepare the ganache by melting chocolate, heavy cream, and butter in a bain-marie.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Wait until the ganache comes to room temperature, then place it in a piping bag, and pipe the ganache along the edges of the cake to create a dripping effect.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Place the remaining dulce de leche and cream cheese mixture into a piping bag, and pipe swirls along the cake's edges.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Finally, fill the center of the cake with chocolate shavings.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Refrigerate for minimum of six hours before serving.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
